# How-To

Clone this repo to some folder ( e.g ```/script/secure-poweroff``` ) and create the alias within ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` or ```/root/.bashrc``` as you like.


```
alias poweroff='sh /scripts/secure-poweroff/secure-poweroff.sh'
alias reboot='sh /scripts/secure-poweroff/secure-reboot.sh'
```

Refresh the bash config by launch this command : ```bash``` on your terminal, and enjoy
